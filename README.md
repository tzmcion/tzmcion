## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Tymoteusz, I am 22, currently working as Quality Data Master in OPmobility.
I work mainly with Images and Frontend developement. I invite you to see my pinned projects
They are very interesting ðŸ˜„.

Currently I am working on a project for detecting structural changes in cells (Morphology).
My strong sides are:
  - FrontEnd development with ReactJS, NextJS, SCSS, & Typescript
  - C++ skills, mainly OpenCV and SDL libraries
  - Small Python and AI skills in Keras/Tensorflow, and DearPyGui
  - I speak Porteguese, Polish and English

Sometimes I see people fork my projects. Fell free to ask me anything about them:

Ciao Ciao!
